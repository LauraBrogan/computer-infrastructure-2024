## Liabaries used in this Assignment
I impoted: Pandas

-Pandas is an open source, BDS-licenced libary providing high-oerfimance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.


## Downloading My Repository from git hub
1. Go to Git Hub using the following link [Click Here:](https://github.com/LauraBrogan/computer-infrastructure-2024)
2. Click the download button
## Whats contained in the repository
This repository contains the following files:

+ data folder
+ .gitignore file
+ Licence file
+ README.md - This document
+ weather.ipynb - Jupyter notebook
+ weather.sh - shell script file
+ workflows folder

## Running the Jupyter Notebook {*1*}
The Jupyter Notebook App can be launched by clicking on the Jupyter Notebook icon installed by Anaconda in the start menu (Windows) or by typing in a terminal (cmd on Windows):

jupyter notebook This will launch a new browser window (or a new tab) showing the Notebook Dashboard, a sort of control panel that allows (among other things) to select which notebook to open.

When started, the Jupyter Notebook App can access only files within its start-up folder (including any sub-folder). No configuration is necessary if you place your notebooks in your home folder or subfolders. Otherwise, you need to choose a Jupyter Notebook App start-up folder which will contain all the notebooks.

Download the notebook you want to execute and put it in your notebook folder (or a sub-folder of it).

Then follow these steps:

Launch the Jupyter Notebook App (see previous section). In the Notebook Dashboard navigate to find the notebook: clicking on its name will open it in a new browser tab. Click on the menu Help -> User Interface Tour for an overview of the Jupyter Notebook App user interface. You can run the notebook document step-by-step (one cell a time) by pressing shift + enter. You can run the whole notebook in a single step by clicking on the menu Cell -> Run All. To restart the kernel (i.e. the computational engine), click on the menu Kernel -> Restart. This can be useful to start over a computation from scratch (e.g. variables are deleted, open files are closed, etcâ€¦).
